"Rich Editing Basics","可视化编辑基础"
"<em>Rich editing</em>, also called WYSIWYG for What You See Is What You Get, means your text is formatted as you type. The rich editor creates HTML code behind the scenes while you concentrate on writing. Font styles, links and images all appear approximately as they will on the internet.","<em>可视化编辑（Rich editing）</em>，又叫“所见即所得”（WYSIWYG），意味着您在打字的同时可以看到最终效果。在您专心写作时，编辑器在后台自动生成 HTML 代码。字体、链接、图片等内容都将以最终效果直接显示在编辑器中。"
"WordPress includes a rich HTML editor that works well in all major web browsers used today. However editing HTML is not the same as typing text. Each web page has two major components: the structure, which is the actual HTML code and is produced by the editor as you type, and the display, that is applied to it by the currently selected WordPress theme and is defined in style.css. WordPress is producing valid XHTML 1.0 which means that inserting multiple line breaks (BR tags) after a paragraph would not produce white space on the web page. The BR tags will be removed as invalid by the internal HTML correcting functions.","WordPress 包含一个富文本 HTML 编辑器，能在主流浏览器上良好工作。然而，编辑 HTML 和输入文本是有所区别的。每个 web 页面都包含了两个组成元素：结构，即编辑器产生的 HTML 代码；还有就是显示，您选择的 WordPress 主题通过 style.css 来向 HTML 代码应用样式。WordPress 生成合法的 XHTML 1.0 代码，因此在一段之后的多个空行不会在 web 页面上产生空白段落。BR 标签会被内部 HTML 更正函数认定为不合法内容，并自动移除。"
"While using the editor, most basic keyboard shortcuts work like in any other text editor. For example: Shift+Enter inserts line break, Ctrl+C = copy, Ctrl+X = cut, Ctrl+Z = undo, Ctrl+Y = redo, Ctrl+A = select all, etc. (on Mac use the Command key instead of Ctrl). See the Hotkeys tab for all available keyboard shortcuts.","当您使用编辑器时，大部分键盘的快捷键和其它编辑器是一样的。例如：Shift+Enter 插入断行，Ctrl+C = 拷贝，Ctrl+X = 剪切，Ctrl+Z = 撤销，Ctrl+Y = 重做，Ctrl+A = 全选，等等。（在 Mac 上则使用 Command 键代替 Ctrl）。所有快捷键参见快捷键表。"
"If you do not like the way the rich editor works, you may turn it off from Your Profile submenu, under Users in the admin menu.","如果您不喜欢使用可视化编辑器，可在“用户” > “我的个人资料”将其关闭。"
"Advanced Rich Editing","高级可视化编辑"
"Images and Attachments","图像与附件"
"There is a button in the editor toolbar for inserting images that are already hosted somewhere on the internet. If you have a URL for an image, click this button and enter the URL in the box which appears.","编辑器工具栏上有一个“插入图片”按钮，用于插入互联网上的图片。若您有一张图片的 URL，请点击这个按钮，然后在弹出的对话框中输入图片 URL。"
"If you need to upload an image or another media file from your computer, you can use the Media Library button above the editor. The media library will attempt to create a thumbnail-sized copy from each uploaded image. To insert your image into the post, first click on the thumbnail to reveal a menu of options. When you have selected the options you like, click \"Insert into Post\" and your image or file will appear in the post you are editing.","如果您需要从您的电脑上传图像等多媒体文件，您可以使用文本编辑器上方的上传工具按钮。当您上传图像文件时，上传工具将尝试生成图像的缩略图。要将上传的图像插入到文章中，点击缩略图，然后选择“插入至文章”。"
"HTML in the Rich Editor","可视化编辑器中的 HTML"
"Any HTML entered directly into the rich editor will show up as text when the post is viewed. What you see is what you get. When you want to include HTML elements that cannot be generated with the toolbar buttons, you must enter it by hand in the Text editor. Examples are tables and &lt;code&gt;. To do this, click the Text tab and edit the code, then switch back to Visual mode. If the code is valid and understood by the editor, you should see it rendered immediately.","所有通过可视化编辑器插入的 HTML 代码都将不会被解析，都将显示为文本。当可视化编辑器工具栏中没有您想要的内容时（比如表格和 &lt;code&gt;），您则需在“文本”编辑模式中输入 HTML 代码。完成后，再点击“可视化”来查看效果。若代码无误，并可被编辑器理解，则将会立即显示出来。"
"Pasting in the Rich Editor","粘贴到可视化编辑器中"
"When pasting content from another web page the results can be inconsistent and depend on your browser and on the web page you are pasting from. The editor tries to correct any invalid HTML code that was pasted, but for best results try using the Text tab or one of the paste buttons that are on the second row. Alternatively try pasting paragraph by paragraph. In most browsers to select one paragraph at a time, triple-click on it.","当从网页复制内容时，根据您的浏览器和具体网页的不同可能产生不同的结果。编辑器会尝试修正粘帖的错误 HTML 代码。尽管如此，您还是最好使用“文本”模式或者工具栏第二行的粘帖按钮。另一种选择是可以一段一段的粘帖：在大多数浏览器中，连续点击三次即可选中一整段。"
"Pasting content from another application, like Word or Excel, is best done with the Paste from Word button on the second row, or in Text mode.","从其它程序粘贴内容，例如 Word 或 Excel，最好用第二行的粘帖按钮完成，或者在“文本”模式下完成。"
"Writing at Full Speed","提高编辑效率"
"Rather than reaching for your mouse to click on the toolbar, use these access keys. Windows and Linux use Ctrl + letter. Macintosh uses Command + letter.","比起伸出手去移动您的鼠标然后单击工具条按钮，使用快捷键显然更方便。Windows 和 Linux 平台请使用 Ctrl + 字母；Macintosh 用户请使用 Command 键 + 字母。"
